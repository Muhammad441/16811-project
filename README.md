# 16811-project
The scripts directory contains the different files we had developed for this project. You can directly run chomp_planner.py or sim_annealing_planner.py or ga_planner.py. 
1. Chomp runs the fastest. 
2. Simulated annealing and Genetic algorithm run for a large number of iterations (hence tend to be on the slower side)
3. You could reduce the number of iterations and compare the solution quality.
